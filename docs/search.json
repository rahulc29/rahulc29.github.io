It is a development\nexercise. It forces me to write better and more idiomatic Rust (the\ncodebase will likely be much larger than anything I’ve dealt with). It’s\nfun : the 6502 is a fun CPU to study and emulate. It’ll be a long\nproject but I’m also planning to port it to WebAssembly and therefore\nrun in the ✨ browser ✨.\nCurrently Learning 🌱\nSICP and Scheme\nSICP stands for the “Structure and Interpretation of Computer\nPrograms” and it’s bloody ridiculously good. It is essentially a course\nin what I’d like to call “the essence of computation”. There’s no way to\ncompletely describe what it is - you’ll just have to read the text yourself, or\nwatch the lectures (available on MIT OCW).\nCategory Theory\nCategory Theory is a branch of mathematics and computer science that\nallows us to mathematically model practically any program. This\nallows us to write unimaginably robust and extensible code. I’m reading\nCategory Theory\nfor Programmers and recemmend it to anybody who wishes to dive into\nthe absolute depths of abstraction. Besides, it’s good for the\nmathematical muscles! 😉\nDSA and Competitive\nProgramming\nI’m currently working very hard to get better at DSA-based problems.\nI’m currently super into trees and graphs and have been solving a lot of\nproblems related to them.
