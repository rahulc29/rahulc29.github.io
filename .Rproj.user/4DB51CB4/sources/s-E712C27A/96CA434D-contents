## About me âœ¨
I'm Rahul Chhabra (He/Him) , a citizen of Geekland and a student of Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, batch of 2025.

I'm most comfortable in C++ and Kotlin, followed by Rust.

## Currently Working On ðŸ”­

### Nesys
Nesys is an NES emulator I'm writing in Rust. It is a development exercise. It forces me to write better and more idiomatic Rust (the codebase will likely be much larger than anything I've dealt with). It's fun : the 6502 is a fun CPU to study and emulate. It'll be a long project but I'm also planning to port it to WebAssembly and therefore run in the âœ¨ _browser_ âœ¨.

## Currently Learning ðŸŒ±
### SICP and Scheme
SICP stands for the "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" and it's bloody ridiculously good. It is essentially a course in what I'd like to call "the essence of computation". There's no way to completely describe what it is - you'll just have to read the [text](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) yourself, or watch the lectures (available on MIT OCW).

### Category Theory
Category Theory is a branch of mathematics and computer science that allows us to mathematically model practically _any_ program. This allows us to write unimaginably robust and extensible code. I'm reading [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/) and recemmend it to anybody who wishes to dive into the absolute depths of abstraction. Besides, it's good for the mathematical muscles! ðŸ˜‰

### DSA and Competitive Programming
I'm currently working very hard to get better at DSA-based problems. I'm currently super into trees and graphs and have been solving a lot of problems related to them. To follow my CP progress, do checkout my [CP Repository](https://github.com/rahulc29/cp)
